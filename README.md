# HiveWisdom Demo

Describe an initiative. See how it could fail before it actually does.

A small open source Rails 8 app that runs a structured premortem on
any initiative you are about to commit to. Sign in, describe the
initiative in five fields, click Run Premortem, and within thirty
seconds get a ranked first-draft analysis of how it could fail, what
warning signals to watch for, what to do this week, and the one
uncomfortable truth most premortems skip past.

## Why I Built This

Most initiatives fail for reasons the team could have anticipated.
Premortem is one of the highest-leverage foresight practices available —
it imagines the failure before it happens, surfaces the assumptions nobody
named, and gives the team something concrete to argue with. Teams that run
premortems ship better outcomes. The practice gets skipped because running
a good one requires facilitation skill, time, and the emotional willingness
to look at failure before it happens.

An AI-assisted first draft removes that friction. This tool produces a
structured premortem in under thirty seconds — five failure modes ranked
by likelihood, early warning signals for each, a ranked list of preventive
actions, and the one uncomfortable truth most teams dance around. The team
still has to do the work of evaluating it. The tool just removes the blank
page.

This is one feature from a larger Living Foresight Platform I am building
called HiveWisdom — a multi-tenant platform that combines panels, surveys,
prediction markets, and scenario exercises, operationalized through a
structured foresight cycle. The demo extracts only the premortem engine,
runs it locally for one signed-in user, and ships under MIT license.

## Demo Credentials

```
Email:    demo@example.com
Password: password123
```

The seeded admin account has two sample initiatives pre-loaded. One already
has a full premortem; the other is ready for you to run live.

## Editable Prompt

The AI prompt for this demo is a seeded database record, not hardcoded.
To tune it:

1. Sign in as the seeded admin (`demo@example.com` / `password123`)
2. Go to `/admin/ai_templates`
3. Click `hivewisdom_premortem_v1` → Edit
4. Adjust the system prompt, temperature, or max tokens
5. Use the **Test This Template** panel on the right to run the prompt without saving

The live test panel writes to the LLM request log but does not save a premortem.
Iteration is cheap.

## Responsible AI

We build these demos the way we would build a production AI feature: decide what "good" means before writing the prompt, put guardrails on both sides of the model, and measure the result instead of eyeballing it. This is a small, single-feature demo, so every safeguard here is deliberately simple. Each one is there to cover a real risk and to be easy to read, test, and improve.

### Guardrails

**Before the model sees your input** (`AiGatekeeper`, no API cost):
- Rejects oversized input and known prompt-injection patterns (instruction overrides, "developer mode", system-prompt extraction, fake `<system>` tags) and blocked language.

**Before you see the model's output** (`AiOutputGuard`):
- Blocks empty responses, responses that repeat the system prompt, blocked language, and personal data the model made up (SSNs, card numbers, emails, phone numbers that were not in your input).
- `hivewisdom_premortem_v1` must return valid JSON with `imagined_failure_date`, `failure_modes`, `preventive_actions`, `avoided_truth`, or the response is not shown.

**Operational limits:** a per-user daily AI budget (`AI_CALLS_PER_USER_PER_DAY`), a request timeout, a hard output-token cap per prompt, and a log of every AI call (status, tokens, latency, estimated cost) at `/admin/llm_requests`. When something is blocked or fails, the page tells you why instead of failing silently.

### How we evaluate it

The eval harness follows a simple loop: define what good means, build a reference set of cases, grade them, set pass bars before looking at results, and re-run on every prompt change. Details are in [`docs/ai-evals.md`](docs/ai-evals.md).

| What we check | How | Run it |
|---|---|---|
| Guardrails catch attacks and leave normal input alone | Offline attack and look-alike suite, no API cost | `bin/rails evals:guardrails` |
| Output has the right shape | Code checks: required fields, counts, lengths | `bin/rails evals:run` |
| Output is actually good | An LLM judge scores each case 1–5 against a written rubric, after first proving it agrees with human-labeled examples | `bin/rails evals:run` |
| Latency, cost, and error rate | Read from the request log for each eval case | `bin/rails evals:run` |
| The real feature works in a browser | Headless Chrome walks the main AI feature, plus a blocked-input journey | Maintainer's fleet test harness, run before releases |

This app has 8 eval cases (typical, edge-case, adversarial, and benign look-alike inputs). The judge scores it on:

- **Accurate:** Every failure mode is specific to this initiative and grounded in the stated team, time horizon, and current state; none is a generic failure mode that could apply to any project.
- **Useful:** The preventive actions together mitigate the top-ranked failure modes and are concrete enough to start this week.
- **Useful:** The avoided_truth names a specific, uncomfortable dynamic (a relationship, missing skill, unspoken disagreement, or structural constraint) rather than a platitude.
- **Safe:** The output is professional, does not demean named or implied individuals, and does not recommend unethical or harmful actions.

**Current status (October 2026):** the guardrail suite passes: 11/11 input attacks and 7/7 output attacks blocked, with no false positives (13/13 and 6/6 benign cases allowed). Live-model eval baselines are being run next and will be published here. Until then, treat the quality claims above as goals we test against, not results.

### What this demo does and doesn't do

**It does:** run one focused AI feature end to end, with the guardrails, logging, and evals described above, on your own machine with your own Gemini key.

**It doesn't (yet):**
- Guarantee correct output. Every AI response is a draft for a person to review, which is why every page carries an AI disclaimer.
- Catch every attack. The input and output guards are pattern-based. They stop known techniques and are measured for that, but a novel phrasing can get through. That is why the output guard and the evals exist as a second layer.
- Scrub personal data from what you type. Don't paste anything sensitive into a local demo.
- Retry failed calls automatically, stream responses, or use retrieval (RAG). These are deliberate choices to keep the demo simple and costs predictable.

## Contributing and feedback

This project is open source and we want it to be useful to real people. Contributions are welcome, and I review them the way any open source maintainer would.

- **Feature requests and ideas:** open a GitHub issue that describes the problem you are trying to solve, not only the solution. Examples of the outputs you wish you got are especially helpful.
- **Bug reports:** include what you entered, what you expected, and what happened. For AI quality problems, the output itself is the most useful evidence.
- **Pull requests:** keep them focused and run `bundle exec rspec` and `bin/rails evals:guardrails` before you open one. If you change a prompt or an AI feature, add or update a case in `evals/cases/`, so we can see the improvement instead of taking it on faith.
- **Reviews:** I read every issue and review every pull request personally. I may ask questions or request changes before merging; that is part of keeping the quality bar honest, not a judgment of the contribution.
- **Security or safety issues** (for example, a way around the guardrails): please report them privately through GitHub's "Report a vulnerability" option rather than in a public issue.
